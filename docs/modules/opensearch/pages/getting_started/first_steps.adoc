= First steps

Once you have followed the steps in  xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[] for the operator and its dependencies, you will now go through the steps to set up and connect to an OpenSearch instance.

== Security plugin configuration

The configuration for the OpenSearch security plugin must be provided in a separate resource, e.g. a Secret:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$getting_started/opensearch-security-config.yaml[]
----

Apply the Secret:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=apply-security-config]
----

The passwords in `internal_users.yml` are hashes using the bcrypt algorithm.
Such a hash can be e.g. generated with `htpasswd`:

[source,bash]
----
$ htpasswd -nbBC 10 admin AJVFsGJBbpT6mChn
admin:$2y$10$xRtHZFJ9QhG9GcYhRpAGpufCZYsk//nxsuel5URh0GWEBgmiI4Q/e

$ htpasswd -nbBC 10 kibanaserver E4kENuEmkqH3jyHC
kibanaserver:$2y$10$vPgQ/6ilKDM5utawBqxoR.7euhVQ0qeGl8mPTeKhmFT475WUDrfQS
----

== Creation of OpenSearch nodes

OpenSearch nodes must be created as a custom resource; Create a file called `opensearch.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$getting_started/opensearch.yaml[]
----

And apply it:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=apply-cluster]
----

`metadata.name` contains the name of the OpenSearch cluster.

The previously created security plugin configuration must be referenced via `podOverrides`.

You need to wait for the OpenSearch nodes to finish deploying.
You can do so with this command:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=await-cluster]
----

== Using the REST API

You can use the REST API as follows:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=rest-api]
----

Great!
Now you can create your own indexes, populate them with data and search for it.

== Using OpenSearch Dashboards

OpenSearch Dashboards is currently not managed by the operator, but the Stackable Data Platform provides a supported OCI image.
First, create the Helm values file `opensearch-dashboards-values.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$getting_started/opensearch-dashboards-values.yaml[]
----

Then, create the Secret with the credentials for the `kibanaserver` user and deploy the OpenSearch Dashboards Helm chart:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=opensearch-dashboards]
----

Forward the OpenSearch Dashboards port 5601 to localhost, open `https://localhost:5601` in your browser and log in with username `admin` and password `AJVFsGJBbpT6mChn`:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=opensearch-dashboards-port-forwarding]
----
