= Service exposition with ListenerClasses
:description: Configure OpenSearch service exposure with ListenerClasses: cluster-internal, external-unstable, or external-stable.

The operator deploys a xref:listener-operator:listener.adoc[Listener] for OpenSearch role-groups.
The listener defaults to only being accessible from within the Kubernetes cluster, but this can be changed by setting `.spec.nodes.roleGroups.{role-group-name}.config.listenerClass`:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  nodes:
    roleGroups:
      cluster-manager:
        config:
          listenerClass: external-stable
----
<1> Specify a ListenerClass, such as `external-stable`, `external-unstable`, or `cluster-internal` (the default setting is `cluster-internal`) at role-group level.
This can be set for all role-groups individually.
