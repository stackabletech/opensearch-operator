OpenSearch Dashboards is currently not managed by the operator but the Stackable Data Platform provides a supported OCI image.

One way to deploy OpenSearch Dashboards is by using the {official-helm-chart}[official Helm chart{external-link-icon}^].

A basic `values.yaml` file to deploy OpenSearch Dashboards with this chart might look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
opensearchHosts: null # <1>
image: # <2>
  repository: oci.stackable.tech/sdp/opensearch-dashboards
  tag: 3.4.0-stackable{{ versions.opensearch }}
serviceAccount:
  create: false
  name: opensearch-serviceaccount # <3>
config:
  opensearch_dashboards.yml:
    server:
      ssl:
        enabled: true # <4>
        certificate: /stackable/opensearch-dashboards/config/tls/tls.crt # <5>
        key: /stackable/opensearch-dashboards/config/tls/tls.key # <6>
    opensearch:
      username: kibanaserver # <7>
      ssl:
        verificationMode: full # <8>
        certificateAuthorities:
          - /stackable/opensearch-dashboards/config/tls/ca.crt # <9>
    opensearch_security:
      cookie:
        secure: true # <10>
extraEnvs:
  - name: OPENSEARCH_HOSTS
    valueFrom:
      configMapKeyRef:
        name: opensearch # <11>
        key: OPENSEARCH_HOSTS
  - name: OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: opensearch-credentials
        key: kibanaserver # <12>
extraVolumes:
  - name: tls # <13>
    ephemeral:
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        metadata:
          annotations:
            secrets.stackable.tech/class: tls
            secrets.stackable.tech/scope: service=opensearch-dashboards
        spec:
          storageClassName: secrets.stackable.tech
          accessModes:
            - ReadWriteOnce
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: "1"
extraVolumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /stackable/opensearch-dashboards/config/tls
    name: tls
  - mountPath: /stackable/opensearch-dashboards/config/opensearch_dashboards.yml
    name: config # <14>
    subPath: opensearch_dashboards.yml
podSecurityContext:
  fsGroup: 1000 # <15>
----
<1> The address of the OpenSearch cluster is provided in `extraEnvs` in the `OPENSEARCH_HOSTS` variable.
<2> Use the OCI image provided by the Stackable Data Platform
<3> If running on OpenShift, use the ServiceAccount of OpenSearch because its permissions are already configured to work on OpenShift.
    This ServiceAccount name must probably adapted according to your deployment.
<4> Enable TLS, so that OpenSearch Dashboards is served over HTTPS.
<5> The TLS server certificate
<6> The key for the TLS server certificate
<7> OpenSearch Dashboards uses the user `kibanaserver` to communicate with OpenSearch.
<8> OpenSearch Dashboards verifies the certificate of OpenSearch. This is disabled by default.
<9> The CA certificate which is used to verify the OpenSearch certificate
<10> Ensure that cookies are not sent via an insecure connection.
<11> Address of the OpenSearch Service taken from the xref:opensearch:reference/discovery.adoc[discovery ConfigMap]
     The name of the discovery ConfigMap corresponds to the name of the OpenSearch cluster and must be adapted according to your deployment.
<12> The password for the `kibanaserver` user
<13> This example uses the secret operator to provide a TLS certificate.
<14> The Helm chart only adds a volume mount at `/usr/share/opensearch-dashboards/config`, but in the image provided by Stackable, OpenSearch Dashboards is located in `/stackable/opensearch-dashboards`.
<15> Mount the volumes with the `stackable` group so that the files are accessible by OpenSearch Dashboards.

After the values are adjusted according to your deployment, especially `opensearchHosts` and `serviceAccount.name`, you can deploy the Helm chart as follows:

[shell,yaml]
----
helm install opensearch-dashboards opensearch-dashboards \
    --repo https://opensearch-project.github.io/helm-charts \
    --version 3.4.0 \
    --values opensearch-dashboards-values.yaml \
    --wait
