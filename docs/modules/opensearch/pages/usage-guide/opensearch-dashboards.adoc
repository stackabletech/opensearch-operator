OpenSearch Dashboards is currently not managed by the operator but the Stackable Data Platform provides a supported OCI image.

One way to deploy OpenSearch Dashboards is by using the {official-helm-chart}[official Helm chart{external-link-icon}^].

A basic `values.yaml` file to deploy OpenSearch Dashboards with this chart might look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
opensearchHosts: https://opensearch-nodes-cluster-manager:9200 # <1>
image:
  repository: oci.stackable.tech/sdp/opensearch-dashboards # <2>
  tag: 3.1.0-stackable0.0.0-dev
----
<1> Address of the OpenSearch cluster manager service deployed by the operator
<2> Use the OCI image provided by the Stackable Data Platform
