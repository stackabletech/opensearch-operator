//! Additions to stackable-operator
//!
//! Functions in stackable-operator usually accept generic types like strings and validate the
//! parameters as late as possible. Therefore, nearly all functions have to return a [`Result`] and
//! errors are returned along the call chain. That makes error handling complex because every
//! module re-packages the received error. Also, the validation is repeated if the value is used in
//! different function calls. Sometimes, validation is not necessary if constant values are used,
//! e.g. the name of the operator.
//!
//! The OpenSearch operator uses a different approach. The incoming values are validated as early
//! as possible and wrapped in a fail-safe type. This type is then used along the call chain,
//! validation is not necessary anymore and functions without side effects do not need to return a
//! [`Result`].
//!
//! However, the OpenSearch operator uses stackable-operator and at the interface, the fail-safe
//! types must be unwrapped and the [`Result`] returned by the stackable-operator function must be
//! handled. This is done by calling [`Result::expect`] which requires thorough testing.
//!
//! When the development of the OpenSearch operator has progressed and changes in this module
//! become less frequent, then this module can be incorporated into stackable-operator. The module
//! structure should already resemble the one of stackable-operator.
